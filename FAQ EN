1. When I enter the game, I constantly get a message about the unavailability of the server, or immediately after logging in, a message appears about the loss of connection (reconnect). What could be the reason?|    First try changing the gateway address when entering the game. Most likely this will solve the problem.|https://midnight3d.in/images/faq/gateways.jpg||||

!2. When I try to open the game, I see a message "Could not connect to server" and/or "Update server unavailable". How to fix it?|    The cause of the connection problem may be different:|||||
!|    1. The game is located in the system folder (Downloads, desktop, my documents, etc.). Such folders may have local security restrictions. In this case, you should move the game to a non-system folder (for example, d:\games\midnight\ ). Or run the game as Administrator (right click on the game, menu item "Run as Administrator").|||||
!|    2. Antivirus Programs block the connection. Try disabling your antivirus when testing. If the problem disappears, in the antivirus settings, add the game app and Midnight3d.in to your antivirus program as safe.|||||
!|    3. Other security software blocks connections. Check what kind of software is installed on the PC and how it affects it.|||||
!|    4. The ISP blocks the connection to our server. In this case, first try changing the gateway from the authorization screen in the game. Another solution is to use a VPN program.|||||
!3. How to use the location editor?|    In the game, there is a location editor with flexible settings. Build a cozy cave or a modern penthouse - it's up to you to decide. Various elements allow you to create truly unique places that you'll want to return to. The game also features a "pinned locations" system: your creation can be accessible to all players regardless of your presence in the game. To do this, you need to contact the project administration and provide the necessary information according to the rules. We strive to develop unique locations, and perhaps your creation will leave an indelible impression on others.|||||

!4. How to use the TV player?|<color=#ffed00><b>    Player Installation.</b></color>\n    The player can be installed in your location through the editor. The object is located in the primitives section (where cubes, spheres, and other elements are located).|||||
!|<color=#ffed00><b>    Starting the Player.</b></color>\n    To play a video on the player, you need to insert a direct link to the video file in the "Enter the link to video here..." field and then click the Play button. All video file formats are supported. You can use Dropbox or Google Drive as file hosts.|||||
!|<color=#ffed00><b>    I see a white screen instead of the video.</b></color>\n    If you see a white screen on the video player when entering a location, check the location of the game on your computer. The path to the game folder should only contain English letters (example of correct placement: D:\Games\Midnight_v_1.0), and you should not store the game folder on your desktop.|||||
!|<color=#ffed00><b>    Room owners are advised not to leave the room.</b></color>\n    If the room owner leaves the location or the game, visitors who are already in the room will continue to play the video file, but those who enter the location afterward (including the room owner) will see a white screen. You need to set the link again (you can rewind the file). Therefore, it is crucial for the room owner not to leave the location until the video is finished.|||||
!|<color=#ffed00><b>    I can't control the video player, the controls disappear.</b></color>\n    You should not place the video player on objects (walls, TVs, trees, etc.). In such cases, the player heats up significantly and becomes unresponsive.|||||
!|<color=#ffed00><b>    How to watch YouTube videos.</b></color>\n    To watch YouTube videos, we recommend using the website Savefrom.net. In the download field, paste the link to the video, then right-click on the "Download" button and select "Copy link address".|||||
!|||<color=#32cd32>Open website savefrom.net</color>|https://en1.savefrom.net/||
!|<color=#ffed00><b>    How to watch streams/videos from Twitch.</b></color>\n    To watch stream/video from Twitch, we recommend using the website Untwitch.com. Paste the video/stream link into the download field, then right-click on the "Submit" button. Once the download buttons appear, select the desired quality (we recommend choosing 480p for faster loading), right-click on that button, and select "Copy link address." You can now use this link in your player.|||||

!|<color=#ffed00><b>    How to watch movies/TV series.</b></color>\n    You can take movies from sites that have links to direct downloads. For example, we recommend the site Zagonka.|||||
!|<color=#ffed00><b>    Important.</b></color> The site is often blocked, so we recommend getting the current link by searching for "Zagonka" in Google.|||||
!|    You need to open the page with the movie/series on the website, scroll down the page and find the download button.|||||
!||https://midnight3d.in/images/zagonka-download.png||||
