1. When I enter the game, I constantly get a message about the unavailability of the server, or immediately after logging in, a message appears about the loss of connection (reconnect). What could be the reason?|    First try changing the gateway address when entering the game. Most likely this will solve the problem.|https://midnight3d.in/images/faq/gateways.jpg||||

!2. When I try to open the game, I see a message "Could not connect to server" and/or "Update server unavailable". How to fix it?|    The cause of the connection problem may be different:\n    1. The game is located in the system folder (Downloads, desktop, my documents, etc.). Such folders may have local security restrictions. In this case, you should move the game to a non-system folder (for example, d:\games\midnight\ ). Or run the game as Administrator (right click on the game, menu item "Run as Administrator").\n    2. Antivirus Programs block the connection. Try disabling your antivirus when testing. If the problem disappears, in the antivirus settings, add the game app and Midnight3d.in to your antivirus program as safe.\n    3. Other security software blocks connections. Check what kind of software is installed on the PC and how it affects it.\n    4. The ISP blocks the connection to our server. In this case, first try changing the gateway from the authorization screen in the game. Another solution is to use a VPN program.|||||
